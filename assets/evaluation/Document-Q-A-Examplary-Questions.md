RAG Evaluation Questions (for Document-Q-A-Examplary-Questions.docx)This document contains test questions and their respective ground truth answers for evaluating the RAG system's performance across key metrics like faithfulness, context recall, and answer relevancy.Section 1: Core System FunctionalityQuestionGround TruthQ1: What is the primary function of the Document Retrieval Tool within the CrewAI process?The primary function of the Document Retrieval Tool is to execute a hybrid search against the PGVector database to retrieve raw, relevant document chunks based on the user's query and project ID.Q2: Which two core technologies are combined in the hybrid search mechanism?The hybrid search mechanism combines semantic search (using vector embeddings) with keyword search (sparse search) to maximize retrieval precision and recall.Q3: What is the main role of the Insight Synthesizer Agent?The Insight Synthesizer Agent is responsible for creating the final, high-quality, and accurate response to the user, using only the context provided by the Document Researcher Agent.Section 2: Retrieval and Post-ProcessingQuestionGround TruthQ4: What specific postprocessor is used to re-rank the retrieved nodes, and how many final chunks are selected?The SentenceTransformerRerank postprocessor (specifically xitao/bge-reranker-v2-m3:latest) is used to re-rank the nodes, selecting the top 5 most relevant chunks for synthesis.Q5: What is the embedding model used for vector generation in the PGVector store?The embedding model used for vector generation is mxbai-embed-large:latest (via Ollama).Q6: According to the design, what is the required similarity cutoff for a document chunk to be used in the final response?The document chunks must pass the SimilarityPostprocessor with a similarity cutoff of 0.3 after being re-ranked.Section 3: Observability and LLM ConfigurationQuestionGround TruthQ7: Which observability platform is integrated for tracing the CrewAI workflow, and what is the specific trace output format?Arize Phoenix is integrated for observability, using the OTLP (OpenTelemetry Protocol) to send tracing spans.Q8: What is the Ollama LLM model used for the Synthesizer Agent?The Ollama LLM model used is qwen3:0.6b-q4_K_M.Q9: Why does the Document Researcher Agent return only raw context and not a synthesized answer?The Document Researcher Agent is strictly instructed to return only raw context to enforce a separation of concerns and prevent the retrieval agent from hallucinating or interpreting information outside the synthesis step.
